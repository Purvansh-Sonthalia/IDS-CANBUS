            <![CDATA[
            <p>The figure illustrates the complex network of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in a vehicle. The Engine Control Unit communicates with various controllers like the odometer and brakes via the CAN bus. While CAN enables efficient communication, it also introduces cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications, while enhancing driver experiences and road safety, can potentially be exploited by attackers.</p>
